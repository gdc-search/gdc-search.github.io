Unlike conventional tracking workflows, this novel approach demonstrates how trackers can control IK limbs, emphasizing the feasibility and stability of animating a full 2D character using five trackers.nnAdditionally, 2D Drawing Replacements are introduced to mimic morph targets in 3D, allowing changing the drawing of body parts or facial features. In this setup, facial capture devices switch 2D drawing replacements to activate 2D facial expressions. Additional features demonstrate adjusting motion capture sensitivity and resetting the default pose to enhance performance flexibility, and allow live performers' movements to be mapped to unconventional default poses for the 2D character."},

In game development, file hierarchies need to change throughout production as experiments illuminate new goals and eliminate old ones. The ability to move, delete, and rename files without unpredictably breaking your game build is a key part of this process as the project scales in both manpower and content. However, we often have highly interconnected networks of files that reference other files which reference other files and so on. Reorganizing files in this context is not trivial and when done manually can cost significant time to do safely. This talk discusses how Naughty Dog approaches the problem of moving and renaming source files. Our solution underscores our studio's value of experimentation throughout production and lays the foundation for a set of new asset management features that our TDs can use in their tools."},

In this talk, David will explain how crisis spurred him to invent a new presentation mode that greatly lowered the spec for art production, greatly increased novelty, opened new storytelling avenues, and solidified the game's visual identity. He'll explain how breaking conventions (for example, common expectations for depicting physical space in a game) also required the careful creation of new conventions, so this strange new format would appear coherent to players.

People are complicated, and when people are working in a group to do something highly complex and novel, like make a video game, the people-complication puzzle expands exponentially. Project and people leaders can often feel at a loss to understand why their team isn't collaborating effectively or why a project seems stuck in an endless churn loop. In this talk, I will provide three \"mindset shifts\" that I have seen work time and again at multiple companies to increase team velocity and drive collaborative creativity. These mindset shifts have been derived from my extensive personal experience, reading, and leadership training."},

I have interviewed a number of game developers and have revealed the history of AI in digital games in the 80's and 90's. I will present this information in this session. It is surely information that will be useful in future game AI development. The history of game AI begins with Pac-Man (Namco, 1980). Pac-Man has a lot to offer to the modern game AI such as meta-AI to generate slow and fast rhythms, multi-agent technology, and so on. Second, in RPG game Dragon Quest IV (Enix, 1990), the player's companion characters grow automatically. In Astronoka (Enix, 1999) is the best example of utilizing genetic algorithms and neutral net learning. From a impartial overview, the overall history of game AI is explained by showing many examples."},

For young developers looking for a career in level design, it can be a long, lonely journey. Infold Games originated as a mobile dress-up and romance simulation studio, and had never worked on 3D platformer or openworld games before 'Infinity Nikki'. Within 5 years, the team scaled to near 1,000 at launch. Most designers are young, passionate first-timers and much of its in-game design came from continuous bottom-up inspirations.This talk will share the 3 layers of developer coaching that Kentaro Tominaga implemented at Infold Games and iterated day-to-day: translate, communicate, debate. In light of his methodology, he will present cases behind real-life design decisions.On the surface, these practices may appear basic, can sometimes slow development and are seemingly expensive. However, its application on the 'Infinity Nikki' team has shown to be effective for the training and growth of young designers, underscoring that investment in team coaching is always worth it."},

When you map your goals on a career tree it can be easy to define multiple career goals you may be working on simultaneously, to document how some goals may contribute to others, and it allows for much more flexibility in plotting your path in your career."},

But instead of simply accepting the energy costs and escapist fantasies associated with games, what are some ways our teaching can \"stay with the trouble\" as Donna Haraway suggests. After all, games offer a unique platform for modeling, simulating, and visualizing climate change while also directly contributing to global emissions, energy costs, and heat. Considering both the ways that games represent climate change as well as strategies for unplugging from or degrowing game technology, we invite six educators to share a single activity, exercise, technique, or tip that changed the climate of their classroom."},

Students created a game while running a rapid PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycle.

However, this type of game is not known for being the most accessible. The team aimed to create a challenging game while opening it to as many players as possible. The question of accessibility and its impact on difficulty arose early on, but there were a lot of challenges for the team, which was smaller than a usual AAA production. nnIn this talk, Rmi Boutin presents the philosophy and solutions used to achieve the team's vision. He will detail how accessibility can be a strength for discovering innovative core concepts, how to provide a challenging game with a deep combat system while making it accessible, and how to plan and develop accessibility without a dedicated team."},

Traditionally, creating these bots is a labor-intensive process, taking around four weeks per hero to define unique behaviors and difficulty levels. Our challenge was to automate this process to keep up with the game's frequent updates. We utilized reinforcement learning (RL) and self-play techniques, allowing bots to train by playing against existing scripted bots and themselves. This method proved to be efficient in getting bots that are good enough to hold their own against players. To tailor difficulty, we developed an action masking system, giving designers control over the RL bots which is normally a frequent issue with this kind of tech. Additionally, we combined RL with traditional scripted logic, like behavior trees, to create hybrid bots that integrate seamlessly into all game scenarios. These bots have gone through extensive testing to make sure they are up to par with their scripted counterpart and have now shipped in the game. This presentation will share our automated bot creation process, which drastically reduced development time required to make bots. We will also cover how the For Honor production is switching over to this new system for the creation of bots for future heroes. We also aim to provide practical insights into how ML and traditional AI can be synergized to streamline game development."},

The developers review the current state of the art in MMORPG backend architecture, breakdown misconceptions about the real-time performance of databases, and reveal how RDBMS + WebAssembly can massively simplify the development and deployment of large scale multiplayer games.nnWhat at first seems like a completely unhinged idea slowly transforms into a logical and natural extension of data-oriented design and ECS. Attendees will learn why database-oriented design offers unique advantages for MMORPGs and how it enables indie devs to build MMOs by simplifying the development through advanced techniques in databases like incremental query evaluation for real-time client updates or multi-version concurrency control.nnWhether you're building your own online game or rethinking backend systems, this session provides insights and inspiration for using modern database technology in game development."},

Traditionally, FPS restricts human-AI communication to simple commands like `attack' and `follow' due to the limitations of existing input methods such as hotkeys and command wheels. These commands lack specificity, hindering players from giving complex instructions like `clear the second floor' or `take cover behind that tree'. Arena Breakout enables players to interact with an AI companion called F.A.C.U.L. using natural language. F.A.C.U.L. can understand complex instructions, provide feedback, and perform a series of tasks. Moreover, it can identify thousands of in-game objects, including buildings, vehicles, and collectable items, and accurately distinguish between different colors and materials. This revolutionary feature integrates advanced generative AI technologies, including voice input, large language models, real-time text-to-speech, and image description, creating the most immersive experience for players and allowing them to work with human-like AI."},

In addition to traditional rigid body simulation, ASTRO BOT uses many advanced physics technologies that utilize the processing power of the PS5. For example, abundance of shiny gems in treasure cave, water flowing along the terrain, and balloons that deform with the weight of the player. Players can interact with these elements and feel delicate haptics feedback. Team ASOBI developed these gimmicks with the aim of creating toy-like interactions that are fun, pleasant, and satisfying just by touching them. This talk will provide implementation details for a large number of physics objects, fluids, soft bodies, cloth, and real-time destruction, as well as gameplay use cases and optimization techniques."},

However, in a competitive game where survival is the objective, there was zero tolerance for players getting out-of-bounds. This session delves not only into the details of how a navmesh based solution was created to solve this issue, but also how this allowed us to leverage navmesh to create a variety of systems, including an out-of-bounds exploit detection system and powerful procedural placement tools. This session then goes into the advantages of having each system use shared core tech in a slightly different way resulting in these features effectively providing testing for each other. Finally, this session discusses the novel web server based, in-game test framework we created to provide robust regression testing and automatic error reporting and how the combination of these systems allowed us to ship this Legend exploit free."}

One of the things that makes Animal Well special is the secrets hidden throughout the world, but it was proving very difficult to communicate the feeling of uncovering secrets within the game without ruining them. We decided to demonstrate this feeling through the use of ARGs in which we buried puzzles within trailers and blog posts. This strategy was very effective in communicating what's special about the game while also giving our community something fun to engage with in exchange for their attention. But there was also a bit of a dark side. We noticed some people in our community chasing after shadows in ways we worried may not be healthy. We'll discuss how we approached this and some advice for others considering a similar strategy."},

Many studios focus on creative development and technical innovation, often overlooking the strategic advantage that CI can provide. This gap leaves them vulnerable to market shifts and competitor strategies that could significantly impact their profitability and market position. nnCI involves systematically gathering and analyzing information about competitors, market trends, and consumer preferences. In an industry as dynamic and fast-paced as gaming, this intelligence can mean the difference between leading the market and lagging behind. It allows companies to anticipate competitor moves, identify emerging opportunities, and make informed decisions that enhance their competitive edge. nnDespite its importance, CI is underutilized in the gaming sector. Many companies lack dedicated CI teams or rely on ad hoc efforts that fail to capture the full scope of competitive dynamics. This oversight can lead to missed opportunities, strategic missteps, and ultimately, financial losses."},

To deliver a big, vibrant, multi-cultural galaxy like we see in the movies, Outlaws needed as much vocal variety as possible, with accents from every continent, bizarre alien languages, and species from all corners of the galaxy. Above all, Voice Design needed to remain faithful to the distinct vocal signatures of the Original Trilogy while evoking the cinematic flair of the movies in an interactive environment and this meant a lot of detailed, complex work.

Released in May 2024 by Digital Eclipse, the Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord video game is a remake of the 1981 game that inspired franchises like Baldur's Gate, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy. The original game had no musical score, so Phillips created new music that remained faithful to the 44-year-old game. In addition to her GRAMMY Award for this game, Phillips has also won the Society of Composers & Lyricists Award, the Telly Award, two Gold NYX Game Awards, and a Global Music Award for the Wizardry score. For this project, Phillips researched Medieval and Renaissance music, both style and instrumentation. Introducing orchestral anxiety into the music of the dungeon maze helped to keep things apprehensive. Combat music in Wizardry consisted of unnerving chromaticism, gestural flourishes and broad thematic statements reinforcing the epic stakes. By combining historical research with orchestral momentum, Phillips' GRAMMY-winning music for Wizardry built a culturally rich fantasy world while paying tribute to the spirit of the classic game."},

(Spoiler: it's not puns).In this talk, the developer behind Building Relationships dissects humor through an analytical lens to explain comedy fundamentals and demonstrate how they're applied throughout the game. The speaker argues that comedy doesn't just come from writing, but also from the structure it exists in. The talk examines the approach behind Building Relationships and presents case studies of other games to explore how comedy is supported by various disciplines (i.e. level design, music, narrative design, etc.).Building Relationships is a silly adventure game where players take the role of a house that's on a date with a building. Described as \"A Short Hike, but stupid\", this game is a barrage of absurdist comedy fueled by improv sensibilities. Hidden behind its comedic facade, the game conveys a heartfelt story about what it takes to stay alive."},

But what about ~mechanics~ in video games being based on The Real World? The Crush House is a game about being the producer of a reality TV show. It's not quite a management sim, or a visual novel, or a first-person shooter - in fact, it is a \"thirst-person shooter,\" where you film things to satisfy audiences while uncovering a mystery. Rather than following the conventional path of taking a tried-and-true genre and mechanic and adding a twist on top, The Crush House's unusual gameplay comes from iterating on capturing a specific fantasy from real life - being behind the scenes of a reality show. Nicole He, the game's creative director, will talk about the challenges and rewards of making innovative gameplay by looking for inspiration from outside of familiar game design formulas."},
