It heavily impacts the final quality of the game and the overall health of the team. Bad closing is a moment of absolute chaos and in many cases turns into a death march. Good closing is a moment of absolute clarity accompanied by a great sense of achievement. Many developers hate closing and some even make a habit of leaving projects as soon as it begins. The goal of this session is to provide clear, practical and actionable advice to producers on how to conduct a good closing phase and how to help their team fall in love with it."},

These new tools are so powerful that it fundamentally changed the way we work with content at scale. By streaming all content from a single server and maintaining metadata of all assets in memory we can make sure our editor, game and other tools remain performant and responsive while working with huge numbers of assets. This led to a solution where we can work on the game without needing to read any files."},

Strategy games often face the demand for large-scale battles with thousands of people on the same screen. At this time, the performance of mobile phones becomes a bottleneck. As a high-quality full 3D strategy mobile game, \"Return to Empire\" faces even more difficult problems. After continuous research and development iterations, \"Return to Empire\" based on the application and practice of the Unity DOTS technology stack, finally achieved very good game effects and performance, and established a quality benchmark for SLG mobile games in large-scale battles.We have accumulated rich research and development experience in the practice of DOTS, and have formed a set of effective practical experience for data abstraction, task parallelism, and logic splitting. We looked at how to better leverage multiple CPU cores and decouple them across multiple tasks. We combined with RenderMeshV2 to optimize the rendering. A set of efficient tools has also been accumulated for the workflow of art assets. I believe that these technologies can be very well applied to other games of the same genre, not just SLG games, but also all large-scale computing places. The potential usage scenarios of this technical solution are very broad."},

These surfels are displayed as sparsely distributed voxels which are arranged in a hierarchical way within the graphics memory. This is achieved by voxelizing meshes from triangle rasterization as well as reconstructing surfels from scene depth, scene color and other data from GBuffer. Consequently, this system can be employed on scenes that are completely dynamic and include vertex displacement, procedural mesh and skinning mesh. Moreover, by tracing rays within each frame, the surfels can be updated and, in turn, the GI system can achieve faster convergence.In this session, we are introducing a novel GI system, which provides a more dynamically indirect lighting approach for full dynamic scenes across platforms."},

It has a lightweight SOC algorithm, along with an efficiently organized culling pipeline, and an innovative occlusion mesh generator which providing high-quality occlusion meshes for the SOC algorithm.In practice, within about 1.5ms per frame on low-end phones (e.g. iPhone 6s), the solution works perfectly with the game's dynamic open world, reducing draw calls by an average of 65% without introducing any false occlusions, allowing artists to create large and complex scenes without paying too much attention to performance issues.In this talk, Wenhui Tao covers all three parts, showing how to optimize the flow and codes of the culling algorithm for Neon-capable phones, as well as how to cut down the pipeline cost by eliminating cache misses and taking advantage of multi-threading. He will also reveal how to use the so-called 'visibility functions' to smooth surfaces and generate high-quality occlusion meshes."},

This talk describes the challenges faced and solutions developed when building Red Engine 4from using a prefab-based hierarchy to build and assemble the world, to the approaches taken for streaming different game systems, as well as how the team managed memory and CPU performance. In addition to covering the technical decisions that were made, this talk will dig into the \"why\" behind those decisions, as well as look at where the technology succeeded and what could be done differently.

In this session, Yixin Hu, Senior Graphics Researcher at Tencent America, proposes a new method: BroadLeaf. For rendering large-scale plane leaves with cinematic quality in real time. Their rendered plant leaves have explicit geometries (triangle meshes) and are single-leaf interactable. To reach this result, BroadLeaf generates and handles the Level of Details (LODs) of tree leaves automatically and provides a smooth and efficient LOD transition. The leaves from different levels are organized hierarchically, which accelerates and makes more precise the LOD selection and culling for reducing the rendering geometry complexity. Learn more about how BroadLeaf is faster and more robust than existing methods, and how it can be easily integrated into game engines or directly used in real-time rendering applications. "},

Often handled by experts at the end of a production, the analysis and prioritization of such optimization tasks is a long and tedious job.To overcome this problem, we developed an automated solution leveraging big data platform. We collect, store, transform, aggregate and make profiling data available to developers through standard analytical dashboards and queryable databases. We also engineered machine learning models to prioritize which system would be the best to optimize.We were able to reduce the time spent on analysis and prioritization from hours to minutes. Moreover, profiling questions are now more accessible thus it empowers all developers on their system's performance, making profiling concerns not only an expert field."},

How do you promote your project and grow with limited funds? How do you fund your work when users and companies have little incentive to support you financially? How do you stay on track with thousands of contributors who may not share your vision?As people participate freely and willingly in open-source projects, the solutions to scale are unlike traditional companies.Using the Godot game engine as a case study, Nathan Lovato, Founder at GDQuest, will explore the many challenges such a massive project encounters: choosing features, fostering kindness, respect, and inclusivity, funding, promoting a project without funds, and more. For each challenge, this session will look at ways to mitigate those issues."},

Those who have accumulated the most power (executives, parent companies, etc.) have weaponized legal departments, ERGs, EAPs, among other tools, even co-opting the language of grassroots advocates to neuter the work of culture change and render it largely ineffective. In this talk, Anita Sarkeesian, Executive Director at Feminist Frequency, uses real-world examples from her decade-plus years of experience working with game developers, and highlights the foundational missing pieces to creating real systemic change that supports and uplifts all workers. She will propose counternarratives and recommendations for refocusing the conversation around actually empowering workers and creating a long-term sustainable workplace culture."},

We then explore strategies to connect the building blocks, build a technical understanding of the systems involved, and save those patterns for future feature development. We'll also be taking a look at examples of how to apply to some of the mechanics found in Destiny's Raids and Dungeons."},

The novel design is for balancing the convenience and the flexibility of the rendering pipeline customization. It keeps the abilities to automically manage transient resources dependencies and barriers, to visualize and debug the render pipelines. Moreover, RenderGraph manages descriptor set layout automatically, decouples pipeline setup and execution which allows upfront validation, allows graph transformation and modification.In this session Zhenglong ZHOU, Engine Architect at Cocos will explain the core design of this novel RenderGraph technology, and how he used graph theory to construct and transform the render pipeline passes and descriptor set layouts."},

Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team, and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session, we will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that we have encountered throughout our careers, and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games.

This talk is a guide for junior to intermediate developers who aspire to attain such positions and realize their potential. Drawing upon his 12 years of experience as an indie developer, Jongwoo discusses how creative leadership requires both the cultivation of one's professional \"edge\" and creative \"voice\". Without having both, developers are often stuck in a \"credibility trap\" that keeps them stuck in their current role or discipline without being granted an opportunity to lead a project. To overcome this, Jongwoo recommends doing game jams, which are an excellent way to deliberately practice game development. This talk will delve into the best practices for game jams for rapidly developing your edge and voice. "},

However, the impact of the long-term use of HDMs in young people are still unknown and research is lacking. Various issues that remain insufficiently explored include effects on brain development and plasticity, vision, reality differentiation, and vergence-accommodation conflict. Beyond the physical, lie the psychologic impacts these technologies have the power to exert, particularly when social components are considered. Dr. Kimberly Hieftje and Dr. Asher Marks, co-founders of XRPediatrics (XRPeds) at Yale University will explore the value of XR in the development of clinical applications and behavioral interventions focused on youth and young adults. In addition, they will identify, and describe how to navigate, the safety concerns that must be considered in the development of XR experiences for youth."},

In fact, many of the most applauded and popular games on the market utilize design choices that support a growth mindset in their players. Growth mindset can support player persistence and can lead to real-life growth in academic, professional, and personal contexts. Three games (Hades, Elden Ring, and Destiny 2) will be discussed in-depth to illustrate the design choices present in these games that support growth-mindset and provide an engaging play experience."},

In this talk, we will be sharing insights into the production pipeline of such a unique sandbox game, and how GIANTS Software navigates the process from pre-production to fully released builds across all platforms. We will also delve into how a small team of 80 people is able to bring 400+ assets into the main title, and how we build our code and assets on a daily basis to ensure that both our internal team and external partners are supplied with the most recent builds of the game.Additionally, we will have a quick post mortem on the challenges that cross-play posed for us in FS22 and how we overcame them. We will also explain how we closely work with our modding community to bring user-generated content into the game on all supported platforms via our in-game ModHub. Overall, this talk will provide a comprehensive look into the development and production pipeline of the Farming Simulator franchise, showcasing the various processes and tools that we utilize to create and deliver a successful game, and how we work with our community to bring new and innovative features to the game.\r\n        "},

In the popular \"Rules of the Game\" session, we assemble a group of established and respected game designers with great games under their belt. Each designer then goes in deep on one of the rules they use on their projects, sharing specific techniques that you can use on your own games. This fast-paced and energizing session gives you plenty of \"rules\" to learn from, each presented in a tight 10-minute talk. These techniques will challenge your way of thinking, expand your toolbox, and in some cases you may even not agree with them.

To achieve that, the team had to question what the opportunities and needs were for this new game compared to Kingdom Battle. The production went through multiple prototypes, ending with the current system.Every battle is decomposed in 4 layers: Arena chunks, Covers, Navigation, and Enemies and Spawns.Each layer is composed of multiples assets tagged with keywords, which are stored in a library. Multiples tags from different layers can be taken from the library to be used in the configuration files to guide the generation system towards a specific result."},

Tests are boring but useful. What if we combined the best parts of each?Our group builds assessment games to measure cognitive skills. When you apply to certain jobs at Roblox, you get a link to a game. After about 30 minutes playing an interactive 3D puzzle-strategy game, we can say something definitive about your strength in a certain cognitive skillsuch as systems thinking, creative problem solving, or critical thinking. And it's working: Our most recent assessment has a internal reliability metric of .93, which is considered excellent by industry standards.From a game design perspective, building these assessment games is an interesting and complex problem. Many of the standard constraints such as monetization and retention can be ignored, but are replaced by exciting new constraints. Gameplay is built to elicit telemetry that says something meaningful about cognitive skills, but hopefully is still fun and engaging."},

In this talk, he'll share what properties make numbers \"good\" for use in games, and how to make your own toolkit to use in your own work."},

Developers have also long been confronted with the task of integrating dynamic indirect lighting, particularly into expansive open-world games, as limited baking is inadequate in effectively adjusting to changes in the environment, nor can mobile devices calculate real-time processes such as ray tracing. Joshua Yu and Leon Wei from LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS will explain the rendering and performance optimization techniques and shading solutions that were used in UNDAWN to deliver an engaging experience. They will also present a real-time irradiance solution that creates irradiance probes in accurate positions and processes them into irradiance storage which is then employed to shade indirect lighting for objects. This technique ensures the GPU's rendering potency."},

Building out accessories that are to be stretched to six different body shapes, while maintaining overall appeal and a consistent read, required modeling and texturing techniques outside of standard industry practices. As character lead, Steven Kosanovich was responsible for working with technical artists and designers to develop a character and accessory system that allowed for maximum customization without resulting in broken or unappealing combinations.

To achieve this, the team at Polyphony Digital implemented a new sky dome rendering system. Sky dome has two main parts: the sky and clouds. The team studied a highly accurate atmospheric model for sky rendering and developed a highly efficient run-time look-up table. Furthermore, they implemented noise-based modeling and lighting with ray marching for cloud rendering. Through this session, attendees will gain insight into a method for rendering the sky dome based on a higher quality atmospheric modelcompared to conventional methods and its use for real-time rendering. In particular, a fundamental technique of atmospheric scattering simulations, the importance of measurement-based atmospheric composition, and accurate Mie scattering will be discussed in detail."},

For many teams, they're seen as the designer's first line of defense, especially at times when end-player testing is not possible or readily available. Internal playtests can be a great source of continuous feedback but that feedback can be biased. By recognizing this, frameworks can be implemented to help mitigate developer biases and maximize the usefulness of internal playtesting.In this session, Andreia Gonalves, a Senior UX Designer at Full Circle, an Electronic Arts studio, will walk attendees through the framework the skate. development team has applied to their internal playtesting. This framework, which can be applied to the existing process of team playtesting, has been shown to empower team members to really step into the player's shoes, to ask for and receive more relevant feedback, as well as to increase empathy, rallying the team around player pain points."},

Whatever path we're on, we can redirect to create more immersive and equitable player experiences.This session defines accessibility in a new light, moving forward from accessibility as \"accessibility options\" into a new era of accessibility by design. Aderyn Thompson, Accessibility Design Lead at Ubisoft, will draw from seven years of industry and 15 years of design experience to dig deep and redefine everything; what is challenge? And is empathy really the answer?Using examples from real life and tech, Aderyn will demonstrate how to mature approaches by avoiding more process, playing catchup, providing \"assists,\" or making accommodations to players. Learn how everything is a system, including bias. And since designers are very comfortable with systems, we can head confidently into the future."},

This is only achievable with solid proprietary tech, pragmatic planning and great team culture. Each game is a mix of incremental gains to core systems, or entirely new approaches both creative and technical achieving the fast-paced output. Condensed production shows the cracks quicker and demands solutions faster and this is a chance to share many of those learnings.

In this talk, Ran Cao, Staff Data Scientist at Riot Games, will present a lightweight path their scientists used to make progress building reinforcement learning agents that learned to play TFT. They built their own version of the game outside of the game engine that leveraged a neural network to predict outcomes rather than fully simulating the game. With this version of the simulator, they are able to minimize the amount of resources required from the game team and still be able to train agents to play TFT at a high skill level and provide gameplay insights. In addition, they were able to make changes to the game in the simulator and test hypotheses with AI that would have been extremely costly to test in the real game."},

Accurate sentiment analysis and semantic understanding of the text can better help games' audio and animation content generation. This session describes a novel system in 'Earth Revival', using GPT-3 to measure sentiment and extract semantic features, to automatically synthesize emotional voices and high-quality emotional, expressive full-body animations for talking NPCs. In this system, the speech synthesis system introduces paralinguistic elements to achieve realistic emotional expression, which can produce natural-sounding voices for final game releases or content updates. What's more, the automatic full-body animation generation model uses the multi-modal context of speech text, audio, and speaker identity to produce the arbitrary beat and semantic full-body animation together.This system of GPT-3 powered text to lifelike speech and animation can significantly improve the narrative process and minimize time and cost."},

Numerous solutions have been proposed, from basic animation and IK-based solution to more intricate middleware such as Euphoria by Natural Motion. However, many development teams find these approaches are either designed to only function under specific conditions or overwhelmingly complicated and impractical to implement. Machine learning can be utilized as an aid in the execution of realistic full-body physical interactions. Our methods have demonstrated the potential for generating high-fidelity motions for a variety of physical interactions, whilst being substantially more accessible in terms of engineering complexity."},

Constraint solving allows designers to specify what they want in their levels, rather than needing to determine how to achieve it with hand-coded algorithms. Seth will discuss a system that leverages state-of-the-art constraint solving techniques to generate and edit levels incorporating a variety of constraints. These include: constraints learned from example levels, constraints on what should be in a level and where it should be, and goal reachability constraints. He will demonstrate the system in several games and show applications ranging from infilling and repair to generating diverse sets of levels. He will also discuss more recent and ongoing work using the system to blend features of different games, model more complex mechanics via constraints to create playability examples, and generate graph structures."},

By drawing on over 10 years' experience negotiating publishing agreements and witnessing relationships between publishers and developers break down, this session leverages stories of failed relationships and conflict to educate developers on risks in publishing agreements and how to avoid repeating them. This session will educate attendees on 5 key publishing agreement clauses and \"gotchas\" to watch out for - illustrated with real-world examples - and how to avoid similar issues in their own publishing agreements. Attendees will learn about issues that occur with license, revenue share, marketing, DLC and intellectual property clauses with the aim to put publisher and developer on a level playing field when negotiating a publishing agreement."},

It dramatically increased the productivity of a small engineering team by reducing iteration time, making bugs reliably reproducible, and enabling robust automated tests for gameplay. This talk uses examples from The Last Clockwinder to discuss implementation details and practical experience, but the concept is readily applicable for many other games.

Writing AAA open world games can make you question everything you know about basic storytelling techniques:How do you write a compelling protagonist when you don't know their identity or backstory?How do you write an epic that the player can experience in any order?How do you write a relationship arc when you don't know what your characters will be doing at any given time?Lead Writer Heli Kennedy and Narrative Designer Brendan Hennessy have spent six years crafting strange and surprising answers to questions like these on the Far Cry and Watch Dogs IPs. In this talk, they will share practical tools and strategies for building compelling characters and story arcs around gameplay constraints. They'll examine case studies of atypical challenges they faced, including an innovative \"play-as-anyone\" mechanic, an expansive open world map with dozens of hours of content, and a replayable story structure."},

Across all levels and disciplines, receiving and offering feedback is vital to the long-term health of a project, the wider studio, and an individual's career progression. However, needs can get lost in translation, especially when a lead or a recently hired associate is approaching a new role for the first time.This session will discuss best practices in giving and receiving feedback regarding game writers, narrative designers, and their stakeholders. Alexa Corriea, Senior Narrative Designer at Electronic Arts, and Lis Mobery, Narrative Designer at Obsidian, will draw from experience with feedback at all levels of game narrative, address popular methods of handling feedback, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of those approaches. During this talk, Alexa and Lis will review scholarly research and give actionable strategies for creating substantive feedback sessionswith the intended results of applying improved feedback loops being: Healthier teams, stronger revision pipelines, and improved individual writing."},
