Racing games and their fans share a closeness to the real world not found in many other genres -- fans of racing games are almost always fans of cars, motorsports (either as fans or participants) or both. Some very crucial aspects of the driving experience in race car games are sonically-related; such as the roar of the engine or the hum of the tires right before they lose traction. These are key sounds that professional drivers are acutely attuned to in order to drive their fastest. Using examples from current-generation games for reference, we will break down the key elements that compose vehicle audio simulation and infer various implementations through comparison."},

Engineers, artists and designers have had to become more technical and specialized to keep up with the demands of modern game development. Contrary to this trend, tester skill sets have remained largely unchanged, leaving test teams less equipped to handle today's titles. Over the past several versions of Forza Motorsport, Turn 10 Studios has made a conscious effort to improve tester skill sets by hiring technical testers in place of traditional test staff. This talk will discuss these technical testers and use bug/production data from the past few versions to show the impact they have had to the studio."},

The project leads from three different shipped projects (Stacking, Once Upon a Monster, and Iron Brigade) will then dig into the process of going from those prototypes to full games, presenting specific case studies of production challenges that their projects faced and the solutions that were employed to overcome those issues.

This talk describes a computational model that was able to identify patterns of behavior indicating unwanted player frustration. The model is based on player behavior logged through gameplay metrics from the game Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days. The framework for the method used to arrive at this particular model is at least as interesting as the results: It was obtained by methodological triangulation, using both qualitative and quantitative methods (e.g. observation, interviews and data mining). Apart from the advantage for game development being able to establish automated frustration detection systems, the model could also theoretically be used as an element in adaptive gameplay design. This presentation is co-authored by Dr. Alessandro Canossa (Information Technology University of Copenhagen)."},

Players process what they see and experience through a filter of expectations. We expect human-like game characters to exhibit human-like traits. A by-product of the quest to improve AI decisions, however, is that characters can begin to \"feel\" robotic and sterile. This session will begin by showing various psychological biases that we as game players bring to the experience. We will then show how characters can be imbued with simple affects to exploit these expectations in order to seem more \"alive\" and believable."},

Additionally, as character behaviors get more complex, seeing agents pivot or \"footskate\" in unrealistic ways breaks immersion. In order to achieve realistic movement, limitations on locomotion animations the character can perform must be taken into account. In fact, the animations themselves can be used as a valuable tool for finding the most realistic path in the first place. Using examples from the games Hitman: Absolution, Reckoning, and Thief, this lecture will show methods for improving character movement by utilizing character animation to help determine navigation."},

This session dives deeply into the relationships between game design, theme and emotions, asking questions like, \"How can games stir compassion and empathy in players? What can we learn about player impact from the way game designers have approached themes of love, whether romantic of filial?\" In these mini-lectures, six game designers explore how integrating love as a core mechanic can evoke new themes, impact the player in unforseen ways, and suggest new design areas of interest to Games for Change. They consider such questions as, how do we design core mechanics that support the theme of love? How do mechanics around love, romance, and affection reverberate through gameplay, and change players' perspectives, behavior, or understanding?"},

While we offer such a course at the NYU Game Center, key limitations of this format led us to develop a modding-based game development class as an additional option. Modding the base code of several simple games in a range of genres allows students more breadth of experience and iteration, and creates interesting team and class-level dynamics that support learning. In this session attendees will get an overview of the modding approach, with examples of projects students have created, and advice for how to use modding in their own curriculum."},

Fortunately, Maya's Python integration provides the necessary functionality for addressing this consideration. This poster session introduces the concept of \"unit test content\", which can take the form of simple art files included within a test suite for testing art-specific code, or scenes generated by a test case at runtime. Topics covered include setting up a Python IDE to recognize Maya's native Python interpreter, using Maya's Python interpreter with external unit testing frameworks, and best practices for building test cases that incorporate unit test content."},

For performance reasons, the HBAO is rendered in half resolution using half-resolution input depths. The HBAO is then blurred in full resolution using a depth-aware blur. The main issue with such low-resolution SSAO rendering is that it produces objectionable flickering for thin objects (such as alpha-tested foliage) when the camera and/or the geometry are moving. After a brief recap of the original HBAO pipeline, this talk describes a novel temporal filtering algorithm that fixed the HBAO flickering problem in Battlefield 3 with a 1-2% performance hit in 1920x1200 on PC (DX10 or DX11). The talk includes algorithm and implementation details on the temporal filtering part, as well as generic optimizations for SSAO blur pixel shaders. This is a joint work between Louis Bavoil (NVIDIA) and Johan Andersson (DICE)."},

This presentation describes a new method for light probe interpolation based on a tetrahedralization of space. Light probes may be placed anywhere, with varying density to capture important high-frequency changes in lighting. Our method calculates a Delaunay tetrahedralization of the point set, which is then extrapolated outside the bounds of the point set by creating 'open cells' along the boundary. Interpolation is performed using tetrahedral barycentric coordinates, which combines smooth interpolation with good user control and low memory footprint. Objects may cache their current tetrahedron and update it using a temporally coherent walk of tetrahedron connectivity. The algorithm is fast, performing 2000 queries in <1ms on iPad2. The presentation will include formulas and code example taken from Unity3.5, but the techniques are general purpose and readily applicable to any game engine on any platform."},

Anybody who has analyzed C++ performance issues knows that the most inefficient aspect of C++ is object copying. Games often get bogged down copying objects inside frame loops. Rvalue references, a new C++ language feature, enable move semantics and perfect forwarding, completely eliminating unnecessary copies. The problem associated with the creation and destruction of temporary C++ objects goes away. The result: major performance improvements in common code. Simply recompiling with C++11 gives an automatic performance boost, but the true power comes when you add move constructors and move assignment operators to your own classes. This talk shows how to branch at compile time based on the condition that an object is moveable or not, with background on how rvalues really work, along with recommended idioms and best practices."},

This talk details Valve's system for using hundreds of facts about the world in a fuzzy pattern match against a database of thousands of possible lines to create responsive, dynamic dialog in Left4Dead and other titles. We'll show a simple, uniform mechanism for tracking thousands of facts and possibilities, allowing intelligent characters to remember history, cascade from special to general cases, and select the optimal dialog, script, behavior, or animation for every situation. Most importantly, a friendly interface provides writers creative freedom to make special cases, running gags, and track additional facts without forcing programmers to change thousands of lines of code."},

QA effort is best spent checking for authenticity and fun, not looking for software bugs. Developers can write unit tests or run extensive at-desk testing, but their time is best spent writing and tuning features. Developer-side automated builds and tests help ensure that everyone's time is focused on what they do best, but automation is challenging to scale efficiently; increasing concurrent soak, sniff, and smoke tests often results in duplicate builds or idling while builds copy. Our two-part technique, involving virtual machines and hard-disk virtualization, can alleviate many of the costs associated with scaling automation. We will present our approaches for parallelizing the build and test processes, how virtual machines can help reduce the duration of the check-in to test result cycle and how hard-disk virtualization can be used further facilitate parallelization and avoid lengthy file copies."},

But in spite of all these innovations, the forward progress of our industry is still gated by a shortage of communities where these common challenges can be discussed. This roundtable provides a venue for that discussion and more. In addition to the specifics of effect creation, we'll discuss ways to continue strengthening our vfx community and knowledge sharing so we can focus on making the most innovative and spectacular effects possible."},
