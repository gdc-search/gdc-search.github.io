It is absolutely possible to build a long, healthy career in the game industry by creating opportunities for yourself and for others, by raising your own voice and amplifying marginalized voices, and by caring about both profits and people. Will this approach lead to endless riches? Almost certainly not. But it should lead you to a long and healthy career that you can actually enjoy."},

For example, games can deceive players by using their mental models against them, eliciting accidental interactions, or employing emotionally exploitative fiction.We go over what deceptive design means in games and introduce and detail novel patterns relevant and evident in recent game design."},

And this isn't a one-hit-wonder. Earlier this year, Monopoly Go! rehashed a similar formula using dice and the classic board game rather than a slot machine, giving Scopely a huge hit.nnWhat makes these strange hybrid games tick? We'll lift the curtain and delve beyond the obvious.

Despite this, many games are based on single player or competitive gameplay and only add friendship-focused social features as an afterthought.nnWe define kind games as multiplayer games designed from the start with systems that deliberately promote prosocial behavior.

But now what? How do we represent a group \"well\", versus poorly? How can we move beyond \"good representation\" to actively de-biasing players? This talk covers a seven-point framework that games educators, students, and developers can employ to guide conversations and design choices regarding character representation. This framework reveals actionable, evidence-based choices students and developers can make so that their games de-bias players rather than reinforce prejudice, and helps instructors navigate the challenges of teaching less receptive students. Video game representations that are based on stereotypes like those related to race, gender, or sexuality influence player perceptions of people belonging to those groups in the real world. So let's make sure students understand how to make games that are a force for good!"},

This year, we are sharing these Inclusive Growth Doorways and supporting resources externally for the first time, inviting all game teams to consider it for themselves. In this one-hour session, we'll share our Gaming For Everyone Product Inclusion Framework, The Inclusive Growth Doorways, and other actionable resources that bring intentionality to inclusive design. Our goal is to help teams improve player access, boost player engagement, and grow revenue. Please join Xbox's Katy Jo Wright (Senior Director of Gaming For Everyone & Sustainability) as she shares our story, resources, tools, and invites members of Team Xbox: Tim Schafer, Studio Head, Double Fine Productions; James Lewis, Sr. Business Development Manager; and Kyle Emtman, Head of Production, Head of Production, Turn 10, to discuss their firsthand experiences with the Inclusive Growth Doorways. We hope you will leave energized by the opportunity and armed with the resources to help bring this to life in your own gaming worlds.\r\n        "},

After the giant con that crypto turned into last year, culminating in numerous criminal charges, even the most resilient defenders of new technologies and new possibility spaces were worn down.But consider this: what if we're the problem? This brief hallucination, without endorsement, imagines what NFTs could be if we took their game design potential seriously, and attempts to place them in the lineage of other discredited technologies that have advanced games in the past.Frank: Notes from my 4-year deep dive into AI. Things I've tried, lessons learned, concrete examples, emerging frameworks and principles, and some cautious speculation about what's to come. Includes my thoughts about the relationship of AI to free-to-play and other business models.Massimo: Monopoly GO!, the biggest free-to-play casual game launch of all time, is bringing together millions of families and friends in a shared social experience.

In this session, Silverstring Media's Creative Director Claris Cyarron dives into three essential design \"plays\" that the team used in Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between to facilitate player safety and comfort, even while exploring sometimes difficult and provocative ideas. Learn how to communicate designer intent, give the player agency over their own comfort levels, create inclusive spaces that feel safe, and shape opportunities to check in with your players directly, even from within the game itself. This inspirational and chill talk is not all big promises and smooth sailing, though. nnThe second half will feature a bit of a post-mortem on Glitchhikers, examining where the team encountered challenges to implementing these \"plays,\" where there is room for improvement, and some of the additional solutions we've employed since launch.\r\n        "},

The team at Velan Studios decided to take a different approach to their title's sunset, celebrating its successes at the end by going out with a bang, instead of brushing an ailing game under the rug.This session uses 'Knockout City' as a framework for how to sunset a game on a high note, and how to turn an unsustainable title into an opportunity for building brand loyalty, player goodwill, and positive press.\r\n        "},

These typically concern something the player \"pretends\" to be inside a game. But another kind of fantasy is often overlooked: \"Player Mythologies\". These are the narratives through which players view themselves as players. Explorer, spy, collector, artist - these archetypes don't just describe a character in a game. Remarkably, they sometimes describe the actual players, and how a specific game or genre fits into players' lives. By understanding these narratives, designers can gain profound insight into their players' mindset and motivation, reshaping traditional ideas of \"good\" and \"bad\" design.In this talk, Alex Jaffe introduces player mythologies, showing their impact and their root causes in subtle design choices. He then presents a case study on the player mythology of fighting games. He shows how this lens unlocked his work on Riot Games' 2XKO (formerly Project L), and illuminates the beauty of the genre along the way."},

It's a responsibility to ensure players who play the game leave with a deeper understanding of the culture, society, heritage and traditions we're showcasing. But the game we make has its own story to tell, and there might not be the space to be educating all players. It might also be tempting to explain and point out every aspect of the culture to ensure a player misses nothing, but this can do more harm than good. Thankfully, \"Lore\" is a very powerful tool that video games are great at that we can leverage to solve this problem.

Audiences can finally come a huge step closer to living their fantasy of visiting the incredible place they've seen on the cinema screen. nnTo make this experience believable, Pandora needs to have unprecedented fidelity, and feel like everything is connected. Every part of the world needs to have a sound, and every sound needs to have a logical link to the rest of the game. The world needs to react to the player constantly, whether they interact with it actively, or passively. nnThis presentation outlines the creative strategies devised to achieve these goals, how to create the enormous amount of content needed to fulfill this vision, as well as the technology that had to be built in order to realize the team's intentions."},

This means that there is a ton of content to be authored, but also large amounts of data to pass through pipelines and workflows to the engine runtime. Remedy has been working on a new data pipeline and technology stack for the Northlight engine that allows us to optimize entity data for authoring at edit time, and performance at runtime, while keeping near-instant iteration times for world editing workflows. The fundamental parts of this technology are OpenUSD for authoring, and Northlight's transformative live-edit pipeline that enables entity modifications to be applied to a running game process on the fly. In this presentation, Sebastian shares how we keep the editor and runtime data representations separated, how the data is transformed, and how the real-time editing between the editor and runtime works in practice."},

In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora we wanted to portray the full dense, organic beauty of Pandora while making the motion feel as flowing and unobstructed as you would expect from a Na'vi. In order to deal with these challenges we created a highly generic and (almost) markup-free system for stepups and mantling relying on a minimum of assumptions while trying to maximize freedom of movement. This talk presents the basic philosophy, concepts, and implementation of this solution. The focus is on providing a solid starting point for those just starting out with this problem and some useful tools for anyone working with it."},

The number of hypercasual products in the top 100 download charts in India grew year-on-year, from 8% in 2018 to 33% in 2022. Despite this growth, the primary hurdle faced by hypercasual games remains the retention of players, as these games experience significantly greater player churn in comparison to other genres. While the average D7 retention for mobile games rests at approximately 20%, this rate frequently plunges below 10% for hypercasual games. This issue takes on added significance due to the rising Cost per Install (CPI), necessitating a focus on augmenting user retention to enhance Lifetime Value (LTV).WinZO identified this issue early in their journey and worked on creating unique and innovative gaming formats to improve user engagement. In this session, Saumya Singh Rathore, Co-Founder of WinZO Games, talks about the team's learnings while developing multiplayer formats, discussing their impact on user retention and monetization outcomes on WinZO platform. Through the integration of these multiplayer formats, WinZO introduced an element of competition into single-player casual games, creating a sense of achievement among users.\r\n        "},

Design methodologies employed by notable architects paired with structural design principles, are taught as patterns that can be utilized by artist and designers to create virtual worlds where the user feels completely catered to. Realism of space is often seen as the only benefit when following real world architectural design principles, and this talk expands this into patterns that help guide an artist or designer into arranging spaces that subconsciously speak to the end user. It is the combined effect of many conditions that influence the user, and that synergy can be tapped into with games just as well as the real world."},

How do performance directors help actors make choices when crafting the personality and physical behaviour of characters? How do they redirect and adjust when things aren't going well; inspire and encourage when they are. How do we inform, but not overwhelm and collaborate to build character with our actors? In this session, Larian's Performance Director speaks about techniques and approaches used on 'Baldur's Gate 3' (and built up over 20 years of directing) to prepare and work with actors for memorable performances."},

It goes into a deep dive into the probe system used to light the forward rendered objects and also as a cache for the global illumination and reflections. The two probe placement strategies, a grid based one and a new octree based one, are described alongside their advantages and drawbacks. Next, it presents the raytracing done from the gbuffer for both the global illumination and the reflection. Various optimizations are presented, including the use of screen space tracing to reduce the number of world space ray needed, as well as improving raytraced lighting quality.The next section briefly covers the denoising strategy used in Snowdrop. Several denoiser options are provided, including AMD Fidelity FX Reflection Denoiser, Nvidia's raytracing Denoisers, as well as two custom in-house denoisers.Finally, the presentation ends on how the raytraced result are applied to the final image."},

At runtime, we sample the learned textures and then reconstruct the material information by inferring neural network in a shader."},

It plays an especially important role for AAA game development, where thousands of build jobs are submitted daily. However, the size and complexity of video games tend to inflate build size and duration, leading to a slower CI and longer feedback time. To provide faster CI feedback, studies have explored optimization techniques that can skip steps, and sometimes the entirety, of build jobs. This talk presents an overview of these techniques and highlights their costs and benefits. Then, it introduces RavenBuild, a novel ML-based technique tailored for video games. Contrarily to existing approaches, RavenBuild predicts build outcomes for both code and data submissions, providing full coverage for a game development CI. RavenBuild skips passing builds and therefore reduces the CI cost, up to 43%, while ensuring that failing builds are properly anticipated."},

Deckbuilder 'Shards of Infinity's' AI identifies symmetries, such as symmetries between players or cards, to supercharge the speed of training. 'Roll for the Galaxy's' AI is designed with holes in the inputs to speed training without creating strategic blindspots. 'Dominion' introduces an embedding layer, so the neural network can learn not only the cards themselves, but the value of their constituent features. This helps handle the highly variant game state where one of a quadrillion of permutations of cards may be in play.

You've refined your pipeline, honed your skills, and spent years building up a great team and studio to work at, but unless you find yourself in a runaway hit situation, it's time to get serious. You're not AAA, but you're no longer a spare-time Indie... you're Post Indie. In this deep dive into a small studios' ten year history, we examine the blurry line between \"hobby studio\" and \"career\", between niche products and AAA brands, and between staying scrappy and being professional, all while building a reputation, surviving a bleak landscape, and, above all, being a steward for the livelihoods your team has entrusted to your leadership."},

Drawing on many years of experimental game making experience and insights from their recent book, \"Game Poems: Videogame Design as Lyric Practice,\" they present practical strategies for using poetic devices in games. Using examples from both well-known games as well as their own portfolio, Jordan reveals how embracing lyric poetry can help game designers evoke complex emotions and navigate difficult topics. This talk is ideal for game designers seeking innovative approaches to deepen narrative engagement and emotional resonance in their games."},

Thinking about players with hands, eyes, minds, schedules, and distractions different than your own is neither free, nor easy, but with less demands to cater to the common denominators, independent game studios are best positioned to serve these players. Drawing from four years of success and setbacks making Quarterstaff, an accessibility-focused game, this talk is about using accessibility as a baseline of success and a core design constraint, as well as best practices for making sure usability is an ongoing component of development that makes your game stand out, and not a costly last-minute addition."},

It's a common belief that challenge and approachability are incompatible that making a game more challenging inherently makes a game less approachable. And yet, we *can* have both! In fact, many recent indie hits are successful precisely because they thread this needle. In this talk, John Austin will break this problem down on a (not too) theoretical level and build a framework we can use to talk about difficulty in games. In the second half, he will explore concrete strategies and case studies from recent indie games that we can leverage to adjust approachability in our games without compromising on challenge or the inherent vision of the game."},
